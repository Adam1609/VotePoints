<p text-align="left">VotePoints is a PocketMine-MP plugin to bring vote points to your server. Have you heard of these? And you can claim rewards by voting in your favorite servers? This is the first public version of the plugin for you to use and enjoy!</p>

## Features
- Simple and lightweight UI-based vote points system.
- Configurable messages (see `lang.properties`) and an exhaustive per-item configuration (use entries `name:`, `count:`, `lore:`, `enchants:`)
- [PiggyCustomEnchants v2](https://github.com/DaPigGuy/PiggyCustomEnchants) support and vanilla enchants (all registered enchantments are actually supported).
- Easy to connect with any vote plugin ([VoteReward](https://github.com/LukeDarling/VoteReward), [PocketVote](https://github.com/ProjectInfinity/PocketVote-PocketMine), etc.) with the use of OP commands `/vp <add/subtract/see> <player> [points]`

## Installation
1) Get the latest release from [here](https://github.com/kenygamer/VotePoints/releases).
2) Drop the `.phar` file in your `plugins/` folder.
3) Reboot the server to let configuration generate for the first time.
4) Set up the newly created `config.yml`. Depending on if you are using `plugins[legacy.data.dir]` in your server's `pocketmine.yml` you will have to search for `plugins/VotePoints/config.yml` or `plugin_data/VotePoints/config.yml`, respectively.
5) Restart the server. You're all set!
